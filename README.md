# Supply chain network optimization for oilseed processing (bio-diesel application)
<p>The problem statement for this case study can be found <a href= "https://github.com/vinaychourasiya/Supply-Chain-Design-/blob/main/oil-seed-case-study.pdf"> here</a></p>
<p>The math model report and solution approach can be found <a href= "https://github.com/vinaychourasiya/Supply-Chain-Design-/blob/main/report_Oilseed.pdf"> here</a>. We have used <a href = "https://ampl.com/"> AMPL </a> to solve the optimization model. We have built mixed interger progamming (MIP) model  and mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model to incorporate different decision variable requirement and objective function</p>
The following figure shows the optimal network flow and techology use.
